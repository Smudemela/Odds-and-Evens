## How It Works

- You enter your name and choose how many fingers (1 to 5) to hold up.
- You choose either **"odd"** or **"even"**.
- The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 5.
- The sum of both numbers is calculated.
- If the result matches your choice (odd or even), you win â€” otherwise, the computer wins.

## Example

```               Welcome to Odds and Evens!

    This game simulates a hand game between two 
    players. Each player holds up a hidden amount
    of fingers on one hand. One player chooses 
    whether the sum will be "odd" or "even". Then,
    each player shows their hand, and you take the
    total of the number of fingers and see who wins.

    For example, if player1 chooses "odd" and the
    sum of the fingers is 4, player1 loses.

Whats your name? Alex
How many fingers do you want to hold up? 3
odd or even? odd
Computer shows: 2
